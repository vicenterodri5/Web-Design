<h1 style="text-align:center;">Math</h1>
<p>If you are referring to the Pythagorean Theorem, it is a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>. A and B are the two shorter sides and C is the <em>hypotenuse</em>.  This formula applies to any right-angled triangle, where you have the known length of two sides, and want to find the length of the third side.</p>
