<p><strong>Monday!</strong> The first day of the work week we all dread to see.  The <em>Mama's and the Paps's</em> san "Every other day of the week is fine - yeah! But whenever Monday comes, bu when ever Monday comes, you can fins me sryin' all the time" in their 1966 hit "Monday, Monday." <em>The Bangles </em>referred to it as being frenzied in their 1986 hit song "Manic Monday." <strong>No one has much good to say about this day that follows Sunday and precedes Tuesday.</strong></p>
<p>An interesting fact about Monday, the second day of the week is that it's also referred to as <em>"Blue Monday."</em> The name is thought to have started because the first day of the work week used to be set aside for doing the laundry. Blueing was used to keep white clothes from becoming dingy and gray. From that product, wash day became know as <em>"Blue Monday."</em></p>
