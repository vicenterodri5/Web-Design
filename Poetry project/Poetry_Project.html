<h1 style="text-align:center; color:#EE9A49">"Are <em>elephants</em> real?"</h1>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"Are elephants real?" I asked my <del>dad</del> mom.<br/>
He looked quite stunned and <sup>shocked.</sup><br/>
"'Cause if they are well don't you think,<br/>
You'd see them in the shops?"</p>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"It's <em>not</em> like that," dad <em>said</em> to me.<br/>
"They're just not put on sale."<br/>
"But why?" I said, "They should, you know,<br/>
And <strong>maybe</strong> also <strong>Whales!</strong>"</p>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"I don't understand," my dad confessed,<br/>
"Why you think this should be so."<br/>
He scratched his head and then his chin,<br/>
"I don't get it. No...no...no!"</p>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"Just think of it," I said to dad,<br/>
"They'd be fun to have around!"<br/>
"I could use one just to help me,<br/>
See the world from off the ground."</p>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"That's true," dad said, "But you should know,<br/>
That elephants don't like cities."<br/>
"Oh," I said, "Well that's a shame,<br/>
That really is a <abbr title="A cause for regret or disappointment.">pity.</abbr>"</p>
<p style="color:#0D4F8B">"So that's why we can't buy them!", I said,<br/>
"In the shops around the town."<br/>
"But if we lived in the countryside,"<br/>
"We'd see them all around!"</p>
<p style="color:#3388FF">In the vast savannah where whispers roam,<br/>
Elephants march with elegance, truth to own.<br/>
Their tusk, a testament to tales untold,<br/>
Reality weaves, in nature's stronghold.</p>
