<h3 style="text-align:center;">Why Do We <em style="color:red;"> Love</em> the Internet?</h3>
<h3><strong>Connection</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a way to stay close to people when they are way from you.</p>
<h3><strong><sup>?</sup>Unanswered Questions<sup>?</sup></strong></h3>
<p>How old is Obama? How long are <em>elephants</em> pregnant? The Internet always has an answer to my odd questions, which is why I keep coming back.</p>
<h3><strong><abbr title="Movies & TV shows online">Netflix</abbr></strong></h3>
<p>Again. Explains itself. My boredom has been <em> forever</em> taken care of my one website. I've watched things I never would have imagained just because it was there!</p>
<h3><strong>Navigation</strong></h3>
<p>What did people do?<br/>
Did they <em>simply</em> accept getting lost? <sup>Help Me!</sup><br/>
Did they actually <sub>stop</sub>stop<sub>stop</sub> to ask for directions?<br/>
I'm thankful I live in a generation where I can become <del>found</del> un-lost 99 percent of the time.</p>
<h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>
<p>Where is the best place to ear around here? Should we stay at this hotel in Florida or that one? The Internet provides os many options and information about places. People are willing to share their experiences, so essentially, you're never walking into something without knowing what to expect. I like this.</p>
