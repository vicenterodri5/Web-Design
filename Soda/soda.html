<h1 style="text-align:center; color:red;">Change in American Beverage Consumption<br/><em>Predicted for 2016</em></h1>
<h3>Growth of Energy, Water and Sports Drinks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pepsi and other major beverage companies are all about developing new healthy beverages -- or at least brands perceived as healthier -- in the new year. Pepsi is launching products like --
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>organic Gatorade</li>
            <li>new Aquafina flavored waters</li>
            <li>healthy vending machines</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Reworking Recipes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Core brands like Coke and Pepsi need to be reformulated with fewer calories or replaced with revamped versions</li>
    <li>Examples:
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Mountain Dew Kickstart</li>
            <li>Pepsi removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi</li>
            <li>Coke Life</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Smaller Cans and Bottles</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>2014</dt>
    <dd>the American Beverage Association pledged to cut calories by 20% by 2025. By serving smaller cans and bottles, can do just that, without necessarily cutting sugar from the recipe.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Attempts at Authenticity </h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
    <li>Tapping into shoppers' nostalgia (vintage inspired drinks)</li>
    <li>Earn external symbols of approval.</li>
    <li>Craft Beverages</li>
</ul>
